âœ… Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to predict player selection and auction price in the upcoming IPL Mega Auction based on historical player performance statistics and previous IPL auction data.

Specifically, the project aims to:

Player Selection Prediction

Build a classification model to predict whether a player will be selected (sold) or not selected (unsold) in the Mega Auction.

Output: Sold = 1 or Unsold = 0

Price Prediction for Selected Players

For the players predicted as "sold", build a regression model to estimate the best expected price they might be purchased for in the auction.

Output: Estimated auction price in crores (â‚¹ Cr.)

ðŸŽ¯ Final Deliverables
Output	Type	Description
Player Sold Status	Classification	Predicts if a player will be selected in the Mega Auction
Predicted Price	Regression	Predicts best possible auction price for selected players

ðŸ“Œ Short Summary Version

This project predicts whether a player will be sold in the IPL Mega Auction and, if sold, estimates the best buying price based on past IPL stats and auction data.
