üéØ Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive analytics model for the IPL Mega Auction. The model focuses on two key tasks:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Player Selection Prediction

Predict whether a player will be sold or unsold in the upcoming IPL Mega Auction.

This will be performed using a classification model with the output label:

1 ‚Üí Player Sold

0 ‚Üí Player Unsold

2Ô∏è‚É£ Auction Price Prediction

For players predicted as sold, estimate the best expected auction price (in ‚Çπ Crores).

This will be performed using a regression model to forecast likely bidding outcomes.

‚úÖ Final Goal

To assist IPL franchises in:

Identifying high-probability auction picks

Making more data-driven decisions in squad building

Optimizing their budget utilization

This project combines player performance metrics and historical auction records to build a reliable and intelligent prediction system for player demand and valuation in the IPL Mega Auction.
